    \brief  Searches through in_signal for the offset into the signal that
            has the highest energy after being despread with in_spread_signal.
            The search strategy uses a hill-climbing algorithm, i.e., this
            algorithm will first search for the beginning/end of the hill (peak),
            perform a hill-climbing algorithm until a certain point and then
            exhaustive search.
 
    \note   This function performs the following algorithm:
 
            1)  Checks in_signal[ i ] for energy above threshold, where 0 <= i
                <= in_number_of_tests and i jumps in_step_size between checks.
            2)  Ranges where the energy is above threshold are created from the
                results in step 1.
            3)  A hill climbing algorithm is performed on each range.
            4)  Once the hill climbing algorithm gets to a point where the energy
                on both sides of the hill are within in_exhaustive_difference
                percentage of each other the algorithm exhaustively checks
                the indices for a peak.
 
    \param  in_signal The signal to be searched for the offset with the highest
                      energy after despreading.
    \param  in_spread_signal  The signal to use to despread in_signal.
    \param  in_number_of_tests  The number of offsets to check in in_signal,
                                i.e., offsets 0 to in_number_of_tests in
                                in_signal are checked, during the phase algorithm
                                that searches for the beginning and end of hills.
    \param  in_step_size  The number of offsets (smaples) to skip between
                          each test (1 for exhaustive).
    \param  in_narrowband_filter  A BPF used to filter the despread signal.
    \param  in_lowpass_filter A LPF tiler used to remove the double frequency
                              term that appears during the energy calculation.
    \param  in_exhaustive_difference  When performing the hill climbing
                                      algorithm the search strategy will switch
                                      to exhaustive search when the energy on
                                      both sides of the hill are within this
                                      difference (note that this is a percentage
                                      difference).
    \param  in_exhaustive_decimation  The decimation factor (step size) to use
                                      when the algorithm enters the exhaustive
                                      search mode.
    \param  in_threshold  When performing the initial phase of the algorithm that
                          looks for hills evidence of a hill is determined if
                          the energy at the specific offset is above in_threshold.
    \return The offset into in_signal that has the highest energy.
