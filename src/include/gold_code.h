/*! \var    gold_code
    \brief  A gold code sequence is generated through the use of two separate
            LFSRs, both of the same degree (r), each composed of m-sequences,
            but that follow specific conditions. Pairs of m-sequences that
            satisfy these conditions are called 'preferred pairs.' For a
            description of the conditions that must be satisfied for preferred
            pairs see 'Introduction to Spread Spectrum Communications' by
            Peterson, et al., Chapter 3.
 
            Each gold code can generate N + 2 sequences that when their
            cross-correlation is taken produce minimal values. Gold codes are
            ideal for generating spreading sequences to allow for multiple
            access to a shared frequency band (as in CDMA). To generate each of
            the codes use the following configurations:
    
            g_1, g_2, i_s_1, 0
            g_1, g_2, 0, i_s_2,
            g_1, g_2, i_s_1, i_s_2
            g_1, g_2, i_s_1, s_2
 
            where, g_1 and g_2, are the preferred pair generators, i_s_1 and
            i_s_2 are the initial states of the two LFSRs, s_2 is used to
            indicate the other N - 1 initial states that are non-zero and not 
            equal to i_s_2 or 0, and 0 is used to indicate the all-zero initial
            state.
 
    \note   N is the period of the sequence (i.e. bits repeat after N bits) and
            is caculated as N = 2^r - 1

    \brief  Initializes a gold code generator struct, i.e. two LFSRs. It
            also ensures that the generator polynomials are valid.
 
    \note   The LSB of both polynomials must be a '1'. Since we are dealing with
            simple LFSP the g_r term is always assumed to be 1.
