/*! \var    spreading_code
    \brief  Spreading codes are generated using a linear feedback shift register
            (LFSR) and should be used to generate m-sequences. That is maximum
            length sequences. A maximum length sequence will generate a code
            of length N = 2^n - 1 before repeating, where n is the number of
            stages in the LFSR (degree). This library can model LFSRs from 
            degree 2 to 32.
            
            A LFSR is composed of stages (think flip-flops) and taps. A tap can
            be opened or closed. A '1' bit in the generator_polynomial indicates
            the tap is closed in that bit position. Each time a bit is generated
            by the LFSR all bits in the state vector are shifted and all bits
            that have closed taps associated with them are summed modulo-2 to
            determine the next input bit. The output bit of the spreading code 
            generator is the right-most bit in the state variable.
 
            For an introductory discussion on LFSRs, m-sequences and Gold Codes
            see 'Introduction to Spread Spectrum Communications' by Peterson,
            et al., Chapter 3.
 
            In our modelling of LSFR we store the generator polynomial as
            follows. If r is the degree of the polynomial there are r+1 taps:
            g_r, g_{r-1}, ..., g_0. A valid LFSR must have g_r = g_0 = 1 and
            we therefore do not model the g_r bit (since it is not included in
            any calculations to determine the next input bit). We store the tap
            coefficients (i.e. closed = 1, open = 0) as a bit-mask using a
            UINT32. The coefficients are stored starting at the MSB always. That
            is a generator polynomial is stored as follows:
 
            g_{r-1} g_{r-2} g_{r-3} .... g_0 0 0 0 .... 0
 
            where there 32 - degree trailing zeros in the LSB bit-positions. As
            an example a r = 2 LFSR with a generator that has all taps closed
            would be:
 
            1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
 
            We, similarly, model the initial state in the same way.
