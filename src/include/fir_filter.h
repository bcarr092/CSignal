/*! \file   fir_filter.h
    \brief  This is the header file for the finite impulse response (FIR) filter
            struct and associated helper functions.

    \note   A FIR filter is used because we need to preserve the phase of the
            signal being filtered, i.e. we assume that the signal being
            filtered requires preservation of the phase of the signal and the
            only tolerable modification is a delay.

/*! \var    firt_passband_filter
    \brief  This is the struct for a passband filter. It contains the relevant
            information regarding the filter, i.e. passband info and sampling
            frequency, and also contains the actual filter tap weights.
 
            A passband filter is designed to allow filter components within the
            passband (i.e. between first and second passband) through the filter
            (largely) unmodified while heavily attenuating frequency components
            outside the passband. In general, a passband filter is composed of a
            passband region, transition regions on either side of the passband
            (i.e. the frequency ranges where the filter goes from little to
            severe attenuation) and the stopband regions (i.e. the frequency
            ranges outside the passband and transition bands where the frequency
            components are attenuated the most severly).
 
            In theory, a perfect filter would be constructed as follows H(f) = 1
            for all frequency components, f, within the passband, and H(f) = 0
            for all frequency components, f, outside the passband.
            Unfortunately, when this frequency-domain function is converted to
            the time domain it results in a sync pulse which is infinitely long
            (and extends in both the +ve and -ve directions) creating a
            non-causal filter that requires an infinite number of points to
            represent. To account for this in practice the time domain function
            is windowed to time-bound the signal while ensuring that the filter
            continues to satisfy its design parameters. A good number of
            different windowing functions exist to perform this task:
            rectangular, triangular, Hann, Hamming, Bartlett-Hannnig, Kaiser,
            etc. Some good references for filter design are as follows:

            A filter is usually modelled as an impulse response consisiting of
            a number of 'taps.' This struct models the impulse response in an
            array of taps which are the impulse response values. We model the
            filter in this way so that it can easily be applied to time-domain
            signals by performing convolution.
