              bit_stream** out_bit_stream
            )
    \brief  Creates a new bit stream whose data buffer is a copy of the buffer
            stored by in_bit_packer.
 
    \note The data buffer from the bit_packer will not be copied to the newly
          created bit stream object. The pointer to the data buffer in
          bit_packer is copied. The bit_packer owns the data buffer and is
          therefore responsible for freeing it. Furthermore, the length of
          the data buffer is copied when this function is called and therefore
          if the data buffer grows it will not be reflected in the stream.
          Lastly, if the bit_packer grows (i.e., is realloc'd) then the pointer
          that the stream points to (i.e., the data pointer) will be invalid.
 
    \note This is a potentially hazardous function to call for a number of
          reasons:
 
          1)  If bit_packer->data is realloc'd the data pointer in out_bit_stream
              will be invalid (i.e., either NULL or point to memory that is
              freed).
          2)  If the bit_packer->data has more data added to it after the call
              to this function and bit_packer->data_length is updated
              out_data_stream will not be aware there is new data.
 
          This function should only be called when the caller knows definitely
          that the bit_packer is not longer being modified. This function is
          provided for efficiency reasons to save copying the buffer from the
          packer to the stream on stream initialization.
 
    \param  in_bit_packer The packer whose data is to be copied.
    \param  out_bit_stream  A newly created bit stream or Null if an error
                            occurs.
    \return Returns NO_ERROR upon succesful execution or one of these errors
            (see cpc_safe_malloc and bit_packer_get_bytes for other possible 
            errors):
