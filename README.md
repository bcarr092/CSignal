Synopsis
========
This is a signal processing library written in C (hence CSignal).

The goal of this project is to provide signal processing functionality in a library that external applications can linked to in order to create cross-platform (e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android) applications that can run on multiple architectures (e.g., x86, x64, ARM, ARM64).

Dependencies
============

This project requires the following GitHub projects:
* [CPCommon](https://github.com/bcarr092/CPCommon)
* [DarwinHelper](https://github.com/bcarr092) (If you are building on Mac OS X)

To use an application that uses this library see [pyCovertAudio](https://github.com/bcarr092/pyCovertAudio).
